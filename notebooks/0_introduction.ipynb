    "\n",
    "Big data's significance in technological advancements highlights the increasing importance of open-source and reproducibility, emphasizing the need for open-sourced datasets with careful management of Personal Identifiable Information (PII). This project aims to automate the identification and obscuration of PII using machine learning models, moving beyond manual processes, and is conducted in conjunction with the Kaggle challenge \"The Learning Agency Lab - PII Data Detection,\" targeting seven PII categories within a dataset of 22,000 student responses to apply course material to real-world problems. The approach involves using simple machine learning models to minimize the carbon footprint and complex models like transformers for higher accuracy, evaluating performance with metrics such as $F_{\\beta}$.\n",
