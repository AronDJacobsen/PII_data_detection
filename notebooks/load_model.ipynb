The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using  diagrams, figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders.  Previous to this change, none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them, but the  new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them  understand the problem in the way the team and I did.\n",

The team uses a series of tools and software to  develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we  created during the process. The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual  way, rather than verbally was a game changer.\n",

The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the  stakeholders on the same page. It allows them to completely understand and feel part  of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions, which eases the  work of the team.\n",
